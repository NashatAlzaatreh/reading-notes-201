### How People Access the Web
#### Before we look at the code used to build websites it is important to consider the different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology.

##### 1- People access websites using software called a **web browser**.
##### 2- In order to view a web page, users might type a **web address** into their browser
##### 3- The request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a **web server** which hosts the website
##### 4- The web server connect the requester to the wep page

### How Websites Are Created

#### All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

### How the Web Works
#### When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

##### 1- When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site
##### 2- Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.

##### 3- The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
##### 4- The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
